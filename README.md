These are config files for my linux desktop environment.

It may or may not work in your computer.

You are free to do anything that you want with these files tho.

If you're interested in those kind of things check [r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn) for hopefully better made setups.

## Warning
If you want to try these configs be aware that the [install.py](https://github.com/Xspt/mydotfiles/blob/main/install.py) script is not 100% reliable, so I recommend you to do your own backup and use the script only to copy the files to ~/.config/

## TODO
- Adjust picom shadows
- Make a better install script
- Better eww windows positioning
- Polish and comment the config files
- Workflow gif
